      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Building scalable web applications is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors. In this post, we'll explore how to create React applications that can scale effectively with your user base.</p>

      <h2>State Management</h2>
      <p>One of the most critical aspects of building scalable React applications is proper state management. We'll discuss different approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Context API for global state</li>
        <li>Implementing Redux for complex state management</li>
        <li>Leveraging React Query for server state</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
      <p>Performance is crucial for user experience. Here are some key optimization techniques:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code splitting and lazy loading</li>
        <li>Memoization with useMemo and useCallback</li>
        <li>Virtual scrolling for large lists</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Follow these best practices to ensure your application remains maintainable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Component composition over inheritance</li>
        <li>Proper error boundaries</li>
        <li>TypeScript for type safety</li>
      </ul>
